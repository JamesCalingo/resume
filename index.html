      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Software Engineer with a proven ability to deliver quality results while collaborating in rapidly changing work
        environments and team compositions. Worked through 1000+ hours of bootcamp structure wherein I learned
        JavaScript, NodeJS, and ReactJS. Before transitioning to a focus on coding, I provided quality customer service
        at the American Red Cross by handling 2k+ flawless donor interactions through donations, personal visits, and
        calls. I am now eager to obtain a challenging position at a prestigious company that will expand my learning and
        build upon my skills as a developer.</p>

          <p>Designed and deployed a mobile responsive MERN application which allows users to create and share lists of
            things they’d like to receive. While building this web-based application, I demonstrated knowledge of
            ReactJS, CSS, HTML, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Axios, MySQL, and JSON web token authentication.</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="project-bullets">
          <li>Leveraged React Context API and React Hooks to help create a readable DRY code base that managed the
            user's state while utilizing the React HashRouter to nest main component routes.</li>
          <li>Engineered a SQL database in MySQL by implementing schema models for user profiles and lists, ultimately
            persisting application state to establish one to many relationships between users and desired gifts through
            Sequelize.</li>
          <li>Architected API to leverage Axios to flexibly populate statically rendered components that were thoroughly
            tested and vetted through 100+ test cases in Insomnia.</li>
          <li>Designed mobile responsive experience using Bootstrap to create breakpoints at various window view widths,
            ensuring consistent delivery of a high-quality dynamic UI and intuitive UX.</li>

          <p>Built mobile responsive frontend application for people to find places of worship based on their current
            location. The application allows users to locate houses of worship through a local RESTful API search. I
            displayed a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Google Places API in building this web-based
            application.</p>

          <li>Styled responsive components with CSS for all screen sizes, leveraging CSS flexbox to create a consistent
            and streamlined application UI, improving user experience.</li>
          <li>Integrated browser Geolocation API to fetch and render static maps to allow searches based on the user's
            geographic location. Using geocoding API to populate Google Places API, searches are autocompleted for
            places near the user.</li>
          <li>Refactored for best practices by validating HTML and CSS using W3C Markup Validation service.</li>

          <li>Architected RESTful API utilizing ExpressJS as the server to save notes in MySQL with lightweight
            middleware to handle security, logging, cors & authentication between client-side application and deployed
            in a CICD pipeline through Heroku.</li>
          <li>Created user authentication middleware using bCrypt and ExpressJS JWT integration before sensitive user
            information storage to addressed authentication and security concerns and tested API routes through Insomnia
            and Postman.</li>
          <li>Designed a relational MySQL database to persist all user notes with updates and metadata by creating a
